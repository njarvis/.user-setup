#   Control external tmux from inside a4c container:
#     https://groups.google.com/a/arista.com/d/msg/sw-newbies/40vTYj1Vx5Y/OR6giPwyBAAJ
#   Using tmux at Arista: aid/4033

# Invoke shell scripts via "sh script_name.sh" as I keep forgetting to do chmod +x.

# Useful tmux commands:
#
# Sessions:
#   Create new session:        tmux new -s <session-name>
#   Attach to named session:   tmux attach -t <session-name>
#   List sessions:             tmux list-sessions
#
# For parallel independent sessions, use -L:
#   /usr/local/us803/bin/tmux new -s tmux2.3
#   protocol version mismatch (client 8, server 7)
#
#   /usr/local/us803/bin/tmux -L tmux2_3 new -s tmux2_3
#
#   /usr/local/us803/bin/tmux -L tmux2_3 attach
#
#
# Moving/renumbering:
#   movew -s src -t dst        Move window src to dst (dst must be be empty)
#   movew -r                   Renumber windows in sequential order
#   swapw -s src -t dst        Swap windows. Omit -s/-t => assume omitted is current window.
#     There is also "set-option -g renumber-windows on", but this automatically renumbers every time.
#
#
# Vim indicates that <pid> has the file open, but where is it?
#
#   cat /proc/<pid>/environ | tr '\0' '\n' | grep TMUX_PANE
#   TMUX_PANE=%7
#
#   display-message -pt %7 '#{session_name}:#{window_index}:#{pane_index}'
#     Displays "bq:3:1"  # Pane 1 in window 3 in session "bq".
#   select-window -t 3   # TODO: Should be possible to do these steps automatically?
#   select-pane -t %7
#   select-pane -t 1     # Alternative to previous command, specifying '1' from "bq:3:1" instead
#
#   The vim instance I was looking for in this case had been put in the
#   background and I'd ssh'ed elsewhere in that pane, so I couldn't find it
#   when I went looking, but this stuff here helped me figure that out.

# Change default prefix key. Back-slash is being treated as a

#     D) averaged over 1, 5, and 15 minutes.  They are the same as the load
#     average numbers given by uptime(1) and other programs.  The fourth field
#     consists of two numbers separated by a slash (/).  The first of these is
#     the number of currently runnable kernel scheduling entities (processes,
#     threads).  The value after the slash is the number of kernel scheduling
#     entities that currently exist on the system.  The fifth field is the PID
#     of the process that was most recently created on the system.
# Don't want fifth field (changes too frequently & is useless), so cut it out.
